  <p>Where Gods go to Die initially started off as a beginner's project for getting familiar with Unreal Engine 4, I wasted a lot of time reworking things over and over again. From a Blueprints-only project to figuring out how to merge Blueprints with C++, I learned a lot about Unreal Engine and game development during this time.</p>
