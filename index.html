    <p>Soul Food is a game I finished for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gentle-ghost-jam">Gentle Ghost Jam</a> over the course of a month using Unreal Engine 4. This project ended up being Blueprints only as the short timeframe required quick iterations, which wasn't possible with the long C++ compile and build times on my laptop.</p>
    <p>I worked alone on the game design, programming, writing and art, getting help for sound and music, my weakest area.</p>

	  <h2>Where Gods go to Die</h2>

    <p>Where Gods go to Die is a prototype I started working on shortly after graduating, for about 3 months. Initially this started off as a beginner's project for getting familiar with Unreal Engine 4, I wasted a lot of time reworking things over and over again. From a Blueprints-only project to figuring out how to merge Blueprints with C++, I learned a lot about Unreal Engine and game development during this time.</p>
